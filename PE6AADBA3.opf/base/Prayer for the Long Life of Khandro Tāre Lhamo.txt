emaho
Emaho!
ku sum gyalwé yum chik khachö ma
Khecarī, single mother of the victorious buddhas of the three kāyas,
shying dir dro ngor mimö zuk zung né
Appearing in female human form for the sake of beings in this realm,
pakyé pendé gopar jepé nyen
A friend who opens the door onto untold benefit and happiness—
taré dé wi shyab la solwa deb
Tāre Devī, at your feet I pray!

rak lü mishik dangmé chi du min
Coarse body matured into the perfection of the indestructible subtle essence,
lé lung yowa dhuti lhum su shyuk
Turbulent karmic winds drawn into the womb-like sanctuary of the avadhūti,
küntok yowa chökü ngowor min
And agitated thoughts and conceptions matured into dharmakāya nature—
khyé dang kalwa nyampar jingyi lob
Grant your blessings, so that our fortune may become the equal of yours!

gang ku pomé dorjé chödün den
May your form be beyond transference, endowed with the seven vajra qualities,
tsé tayepé gön shyin tso shyé sol
So that you abide just like Amitāyus, Lord of Boundless Life, himself!
zangpö trinlé ta dün zer treng gi
And may the garlanded rays of your sun-like beneficence
dro kham lha lam khyön kün geng gyur chik
Reach out to fill the heavenly skies throughout this world!

Thus Ngawang Lodrö Tsungme spontaneously composed this prayer. May it be fulfilled through the
veritable power of the victorious buddhas and their heirs! Virtue!
